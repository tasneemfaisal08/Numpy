# Numpy
This repository is a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing NumPy.

# What is NumPy?
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

# Why Use NumPy?
In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.

The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

# some of the things that Numpy provides:
1- ndarray, a fast and space-efficient multidimensional array providing vectorized arithmetic operations and sophisticated broadcasting capabilities

2- Standard mathematical functions for fast operations on entire arrays of data without having to write loops

3- Tools for reading / writing array data to disk and working with memory-mapped files

4- Linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transform capabilities

5- Tools for integrating code written in C, C++, and Fortran

# Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?
NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.

This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.

This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.

# Which Language is NumPy written in?
NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.

# Where is the NumPy Codebase?
The source code for NumPy is located at this github repository  https://github.com/numpy/numpy
